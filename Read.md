# Source Control seems to go alot smoother when you have made a few mistakes and corrected your errors.
# The fewer mistakes you make, the less errors you have to go through.
# Relearning what someonelse knows about source control is a way to learn.
# To learn "Git" takes patience and you may have to tube a few demonstrations or different point of views.
# Learning to push, fetch, and pull will potentially save you countless hours of rewritting code.
# It's great to learn what everyone else knows as old hat!
# Good Karma with Open Source.
